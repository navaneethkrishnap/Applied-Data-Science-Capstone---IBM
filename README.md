# project overview 

## 1. Collecting the Data (API) 
we collect SpaceX launch data using the SpaceX REST API, process it into a structured format, and clean the dataset by filtering for Falcon 9 launches and handling missing values. The cleaned data is used to analyze and predict rocket landing attempts.
